### Introduction
This was my fourth (last) project from Mod3 at Turing School of Software and Design. I was given six days to create a unique React app utilizing React Router, React Redux, and the `fetch()` method to `GET` data from an API. I chose to create a music trivia game for mobile devices using the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com) to populate the questions. A major learning goal for this project was to create a robust testing suite using Jest and Enzyme to ensure all components and user interactions function correctly.

### Directions for Use
- On page load the user will see an intro screen asking for a name and difficulty.
- After selecting `START GAME` the user will see their first of ten question prompts with four possible answers.
- Selecting an answer, then selecting the `SUBMIT ANSWER` button will reveal a confirmation message letting the user know if they were correct or incorrect.
- There is a header at the top of the screen that persists throughout the game displaying the current question, number of right and wrong responses, and the current difficulty.
- At the end of the game the user will see their score given as a percentage as well as cards representing all missed questions with the user's answer and the correct answer.
- There is a `NEW GAME` button on the last screen enabling a user to start a new game.

### Project Goals and Requirements
- Use the technology you‚Äôve been working with over the course of the module to demonstrate mastery of React, Redux, Router, and Asynchronous JavaScript.
- Work within constraints to deliver a unique product for your audience which helps them in some way. Your project must utilize your assigned API and technology, and must be built for your assigned audience.
- Your applications should have the following core functionality:
-- Display the data from the API in a way that applies directly to your audience
-- Ability for users to store/manipulate the data displayed in the application, such as favoriting or adding to a list

### Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- React
- Router
- Redux
- Jest/Enzyme
- NPM

### How to run on a local machine
1. shut down any live servers you currently have running (`control` + `c`)
2. clone down this repo to desired location
3. cd to the directory where you cloned the repo
4. run `npm install`
5. run `npm start`
6. you should now be able to run the app within your browser from the url: `http://localhost:3000/intro`
